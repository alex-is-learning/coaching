# Client 1
- *From a voice note from a friend who I did weekly coaching with
- “This is so valuable to me, so grateful, fact that you’re like ‘do you wanna do a weekly one’ I’m like yes this is so valuable”
    - ⁠almost like “omg are you sure I’m allowed it, that’s very generous” which ==points to how valuable this is==
    - ⁠because just the container is valuable, if you’re like “I wanna try a specific exercise for 5 mins”, happy to do it!
    - ⁠feel like I’m getting a great deal so would love to help you with your goals as well
- Why this is specifically valuable to me:
	- Talking, having all these thoughts and feelings, having the ==outlet== to talk about them
	- You providing a ==safe and non-judgemental place==, knowing the [[VIEW]] framework, being in [[Self]][^1], if you’re sitting there and feeling in Self, calm compassionate curious etc, that’s kinda all that’s required
	- So much of it is being able to ==hold the space==, it’s safe for me to share, also reassuring me too, “omg i’m talking too much!” “no this is what this is for!”
    - ⁠Saying all this stuff out loud, then being able to connect the dots, stuff makes sense as i’m saying it, having a ==witness==, kinda how Focusing works too, transforming to be witnessed, safe & ok
    - ⁠Also, because of transference (Freudian thing, therapist provides the thing that was missing) -> ==attachment== can be healed, safe container. So by you being there, safe witness and container, therefore facilitating healing (in my specific case)
- Specific positive feedback
	1. The fact that you’re asking how you can get better -> here’s someone who genuinely wants to do a good job at what they’re doing -> you’d think this’d be normal but so many coaches/therapists just do the training
	 2. You having the confidence to hold the space to do something like “let’s pause and do a meditation”, another IFS therapist just ended up being talk therapy -> requires a lot of confidence for the other person to take charge, “ok we’re doing this, we’re dropping into the body”, vs just doing the comfy thing of talking
