Snowfall is a hamlet on the Molgoroth Mountains. It is located far away from roads and other villages. There are approximately 75 people who live in the hamlet. Their economy mainly relies on forestry; they chop up the trees and sell them to other towns and villages in exchange for jerky, stock fish, wheat and salt. There are also some eagle-tamers living in the hamlet, they tame eagles both on request and to sell in the markets.
Since the region is cold and windy, farming is not an option. People live in leather tents made of animal skin, and the settlement is located in very high altitude due to the special requirements of eagle-taming.
The hamlet is ruled by the most talented eagle tamer Mina Nikoline. She has very long blonde hair, which she likes to braid. She has two eagles.
