- Kroksholt is a city ruled by [[Queen Bergljot]]’s step-sister, [[Hora]]. She is well-known and loved by the people
- Many people think that this love and respect will be the end of Hora, because Bergljot won’t be able to handle this situation and Hora will transform into a threat to Queen Bergljot’s throne
- Its location on the road to the capital makes it a booming trading city, with the population and wealth growing more and more. Wheat and many vegetables such as cabbage and maize are grown by settlers, and animal farms full of pigs and goats are maintained. The forestry and herbalism are also preferable jobs around the city
- The overall appearance is very nice compared to lots of towns and cities in Svilland; the streets are cleaner; the buildings and city walls are well-maintained and strong
- People are not only welcoming but also friendly to travellers, because most of the city-dwellers need a helping hand for their jobs. For this reason one can easily find daily jobs around the city and a place to stay. So, travellers can find many taverns and inns in Kroksholt
- There is also a temple to [[Thor]] which is famous for its altar. Some bards say, “the blood flowing from the altar never stops.” The very religious residents of the city always wash the altar with animal blood, and fresh fruits. The temple was built with the help of Sister Hora, so it is said that she is very much liked by Thor.
