### Intro

A Century has passed Since the God-King [[Othedias]] betrayed the pantheon, provoking the divine punishment and abandonment by the gods that left the realm of the [[Halcyon Domain]] shattered, desolate, and eternally cursed. Throughout this shadow-choked land of decaying fortresses and dreadful monstrosities, surviving communities cling to hope in the face of lightless oblivion. In an [[Age of Umbra]] campaign you will play as heroic survivors who protect their community from the terrors beyond their walls, venture out into the unknown to hunt the nightmares that twist and grow with each fallen soul, seek answers to the cures that corrupt this world, and perhaps even discover a way to change its fate.

### Story

The [[Age of Umbra]] is a dark and broken age within the realm known as the [[Halcyon Domain]], which rots in the wake of its Pantheon's abandonment. Grandiose cities and awe-inspiring cathedrals to the [[Veiled Gods]] now crumble slowly into ruin, fallen bastions of the prosperous epoch ruled by God-King [[Othedias]]. [[Othedias]] ,Chosen by the [[Veiled Gods]] as the bridge to divinity, conspired with his Grand Ordinants and Aetherlords to enact secret schemes that could shift the balance in celestial power. That resulted in enraging the pantheon.

His blasphemy was met with cataclysmic retributions. The gods rained destruction upon the land, ending the old world and forsaking the surviving peoples of the [[Halcyon Domain]] to an existence of growing desolation. The [[Veiled Gods]] then abandoned this world in what is referred as the [[apostasy]], leaving what remains to wither under an ever-growing shadow. With every generation, the skies grow darker, mourning the world’s steady descent into chaos and eventual oblivion.

The cycle of the soul has been broken, cursing all who live or will ever live with the "soul blight" a mark upon every mortal ensuring that, upon their death, they will rise again as a corrupt revenant bent on destroying everything they loved in their former life. If their risen body is destroyed, the marked soul withdraws into the dark, ethereal mass known as the [[The Umbra]], seeking others to haunt and corrupt.

It's been nearly over a century within the [[Age of Umbra]], and those who remain rebuild what they can among the ruins of the Old World. Referring to themselves as [[The Enduring]],  these scattered communities of survivors  huddle within reinforced battlements where [[Sacred Pyres]] burn as a beacon of hope and safety. Most [[The Enduring|Enduring]] are trained to survive and defend themselves in this bleak land from a very young age, many honed into fierce warriors and [[Aetherweavers]] through hardship and necessity by the time they reach adulthood. Bands of hunters brave the cracked and twisted landscape beyond their walls each day to gather sustenance, recover materials, and connect or trade with other surviving settlements. 

However, many of the outside world's wandering beasts have mutated from the corruption of [[The Umbra]]; this Transient storm of twisted souls merges with and change the creatures into nightmarish beasts that stalk, rage, and evolve with each newly fused spectre. When these monstrosities slay those who confront the wilds, their victims blighted souls join the horrors that claimed them.
