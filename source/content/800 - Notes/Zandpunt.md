#### Description
Is a small fortified community originally formed from sailors and farmers who were part of the Elder Vale land. But Zandpunt is not anymore what it looked like 100 years ago. "When the first Umbral Storm struck, the waters surged without mercy, engulfing the city in the cold grip of the Ashen Sea. All that remains are the highest spires and broken domes, peeking out of the gloom like tombstones in a vast, sunken grave. A few of the enduring saw opportunity in the ruin. The waters surrounding the last visible peaks became a natural barrier against the umbra-touched. The survivors raised new walls from the remnants of the submerged city, reforging what was once underwater into a protective ring around [[Zandpunt]]. To the east, it shields against the swamp creatures. To the south, it holds back the drifting dead. To the west, it stands against the Ashen Sea and the horrors that stir beneath its waves. And to the north an unlookable monster if rumor has it that if you look in its eyes you die. #Question
