![[Halcyan Domain.jpg]]

The [[Halcyon Domain]], a plane with in the north the Griefclef Mountains. A mountain range protects that the [[Amber Reach]] from the cold northern storms. The [[Amber Reach]], once a great monument displaying the prosperity and wealth of the [[Halcyon Domain]]. Now lies in rumble after what happened during the [[apostasy]]. It's great halls was once filled with kings and noblemen, Now wandered by Beasts and Looters. These scoundrels, Known as [[The Damask Queens]], do not believe in the return of the gods and the protection of the [[Sacred Pyres]]. They embrace the umbra as a new form of living and want all the spoils of the [[apostasy]] for themselves. Their main base of operations lies in the Cinnabar Quarters, But often they venture in the Ashcall Quarters to find more spoils. South of the Ashcall Quarters a group of enduring turned the [[Celenium Athenium]], a place of higher learning filled with great libraries and collages, into a stronghold. These Enduring are seeking ways to ask for forgiveness to the [[Veiled Gods]]. They believe the secret to what happened is hidden deep in the dungeons of the [[Amber Reach]], where [[Othedias]] was experimenting with his Aetherlords to overthrow the [[Veiled Gods]]. Obtaining this information is their highest priority, and will be done by any means necessary. Resulting in violent battles against the creatures of the umbra and [[The Damask Queens]]. 

The middle of this plane was a grand farmland with many trade outposts. The low land close to the sea was perfect for natural irrigation systems, over the prosperous years of the [[Halcyon Domain]]. The farmland became bigger and the inhabitants build small canals to bring water further in the mainland. People from all over the [[Halcyon Domain]] came here to trade their valuables for the majestic crops that this land was able to provide. Shortly after the [[apostasy]] the first Umbral winds passed the [[Halcyon Domain]]. A storm like never before hit the shores and raged over the land. The people that survived the [[apostasy]] tried to save their houses and belonging but with the sheer force of the Umbral winds, the soft acid rain, and the lightning strikes causing fire, almost everything got destroyed.  After the storm passed over the Griefcelf Mountains and vanished in the distance the once great farmlands turned into a swamp. The amount of rain raised the level of the sea that the low lands flooded turning it into a swamp filled with corpses and umbra touched creatures after the recent storm.

In the South-West, The tall idol hollows hold the Fortress of Okros. A city born from slave miners, their masters perished at the hand of the [[Veiled Gods]] during the [[apostasy]].  These people, miners by trade have tried for generations to find artifacts of a time before the land was claimed by dukes and kings. A time when people were desperate for help and sought it with first gods. For generations [[The Enduring]] from Okros dug in the nearby caves in search of these artifacts. Recently a group started digging further west and found some old buildings they call this site The Shalk Shasm. They believe that in these ruins an old temple lies with answers about [[The Umbra]] and how to banish [[The Umbra|it]]. While trying to uncover its secrets old souls buried deep in the the Shalk Shasm got awakened by the ever roaming presence of [[The Umbra]] and progress slowed down. Now venturing parties of [[Delvers]], sworn protectors of Okros, go to the Shalk Shasm and try to uncover the secrets buried deep within.
