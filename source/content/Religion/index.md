Also known as the Arch-Seraphs, the Frihetskjold pantheon are a group of mortals who managed to reach godhood by killing Greek and Norse gods and absorbing their essence. The Frihetskjold represent free will and ambition as the Greek and Norse gods wished to use mortals as play things. The Frihetskjold very famously killed The Three Fates when they were mortal so that fate is less of a shackle, though the Norns still exist.
