The patron of good-aligned warriors, Thamak seeks to push back the influence of the Aether Kindred and return Midgard to its Golden Age. His uncompromising nature differs from that of Apheleon, his counterpart in war. He drives his followers to become zealots bent on cleansing the world of whatever they perceive as sources of corruption.
