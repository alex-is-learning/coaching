Aphaeleon is the patron god of generals and strategists.  Aphaeleon embodies war not as bloodshed, but as intellect wielded with discipline. He is the god of strategic warfare, Aphaeleon favors structure, foresight, and victory earned through superior tactics. Commanders who choose cunning over carnage whisper prayers to him. His favor is found not in brute force, but in the efficient application of power, wars won with minimal loss and every movement of troops made with calculated precision. Aphaeleon and Thamak can be thought of as two sides of the same coin when it comes to war, similar to how Athena and Ares were.
