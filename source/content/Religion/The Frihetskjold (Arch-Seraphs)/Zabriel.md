A former archivist of the knowledge god Apollo, Zabriel was one of those who abandoned the ideals of their god, to pursue her own agenda. Whereas Apollo was neutrally-aligned and sought knowledge for the sake of knowledge, Zabriel sought to weaponize knowledge and truth. She is the patron of scholars, truth-seekers, counterspies, and those who seek to bring down conspiracies and oppressive regimes. Those who follow her often gain flashes of inspiration that lead them to discover secrets.
