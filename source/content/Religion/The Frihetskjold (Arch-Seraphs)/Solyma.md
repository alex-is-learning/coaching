Solyma remains faithful to the dead god of supreme justice. She has undertaken a vow of silence and will not speak until the cosmic horror that destroyed her master has been defeated for good. Until then, she does what she can to help those who seek justice in all its forms. Good-aligned vigilantes and those who destroy the abominations of the Aether Kindred can expect great rewards from Solyma. But Solyma’s silence has come with a cost, and her faithful stray without guidance. The name of the god who Solyma once served has been forgotten by mortalkind, and their teachings twisted to serve mortal ends. Solyma’s most fervent worshippers reside in Greek Lands, where whispered prayers call her the Lady of Vengeance and bloody vendettas are prosecuted in her name. Yet who is to say their idea of justice is wrong, if not silent Solyma herself? True justice, Solyma argues, isn’t merely the enforcement of the letter of existing laws, but the establishment of equitable and compassionate relationships among all of the worlds people. That means protecting the weak from the depredations of the strong, sheltering the innocents who are threatened by war, and ensuring that enforcement of the law doesn’t become oppressive. Solyma actively supports efforts to establish a lasting peace.
