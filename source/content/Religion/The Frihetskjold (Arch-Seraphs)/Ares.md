The most contemplative and peaceful of the Arch-Seraphs, Ares is the patron of monks and clerics. Formerly the god of war for the Greek pantheon, he has taken a different path and is now prayed to by those who seek freedom from their worldly desires. Ares helps his followers resist their addictions and temptations. Those who follow his ways find great mental and spiritual strength that enables them to endure. Ares acts as the mediator between the Frihetskjold gods. It is said that the sight of him alone brings a sense of inner peace.
