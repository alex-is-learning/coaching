When you open the door to this white-furred, red-eyed rat’s cage, they point their nose in the direction of the nearest magic item within 30 feet that isn’t worn or carried by another creature for 1 minute or until you shut the door. After pointing at a magic item, the rat refuses to do so again until they consume a piece of cheese worth at least 10 gp.
