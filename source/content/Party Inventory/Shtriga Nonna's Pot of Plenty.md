_Wondrous Item, Uncommon_
This black iron pot weighs only 2 pounds. As an action, you can speak one of the following command phrases to activate its effect:

***Boil, Boil, Until You Spoil.***
	The cauldron fills with a hearty stew. It creates enough stew to feed fifteen Humanoids. The food is tasty and seasoned well, and spoils if uneaten after 24 hours.

***Bubble, Bubble, Toil and Trouble.***
	The cauldron fills with stew, as if you said “Boil, boil, until you spoil,” but the stew is poisoned. A creature who consumes the stew must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for the next 24 hours.

Once the pot has been used in one of these ways, it can’t be used again until the next dusk.
