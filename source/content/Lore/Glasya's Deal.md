# The Covenant
## By Will and Word of Glasya, Princess of Malbolge, Keeper of Chains, Daughter of Asmodeus, and Mistress of the Silent Court
## Preamble
Let it be known upon this day, beneath the shadow of the Nine and in witness of the Infernal Codex, that an accord is struck between ***Her Infernal Grace, Glasya of Malbolge***, and ***Helwyn, Horn-Bearer and Mortal Supplicant***.

This document is binding across all planes, through fire and void, and may not be sundered by mortal plea, divine intercession, or arcane trickery.
## Articles of Accord
### Article I — The Bound Sovereignty
Glasya, Princess of the Nine Hells, by this pact, ***swears upon her station, blood, and chains***, to ***refrain from interference, meddling, or orchestration of harm, hindrance, or manipulation*** of Helwyn, and of those companions who, at the moment of this covenant’s signing, yet draw breath and are counted as her allies and companions-in-arms.

Such protection extends only to those alive at this hour, and ***does not bind Glasya in relation to future allies, descendants, or associates yet unborn, unnamed, or unknown.***
### Article II — The Price Rendered
In exchange for the sovereign restraint of Glasya:
1. ***Helwyn surrenders her horns***, to be shorn, claimed, and fashioned as a token of Glasya’s dominion. They shall remain forever in her possession, never to be restored.
2. ***Helwyn surrenders her soul***, to be seized upon signing, torn from her husk, and consigned to Malbolge’s crucible. There, it shall dwell for eternity, to be reshaped and repurposed at Glasya’s whim.
No divine rite, mortal bargain, or arcane theft may retrieve or ransom this soul once claimed.
### Article III — The Exceptions
The non-interference of Glasya holds ***save in the event*** that:
* Helwyn herself seeks her audience, calls her name, or invokes her symbol.
* Helwyn raises blade, spell, or word against Glasya, her Erinyes, or her lawful agents.
* Helwyn, through action or neglect, ***invites contradiction with the terms herein***, at which point this pact becomes null, and her life is forfeit immediately.
### Article IV — The Seal of Beauty
Glasya, being lover of symmetry and scorner of ugliness, shall ensure that the removal of Helwyn’s horns be performed with elegance and grace. The act shall not mar his mortal form beyond what is aesthetically tolerable in the eyes of the Princess.
## Witness and Binding
By horn and hand, by ink of flame, this covenant is etched into the Infernal Codex and echoed through the iron vaults of Nessus.
* ***Signed and Sealed:*** Glasya, Princess of Malbolge, Lady of Chains, The Dark Prodigy, The Beloved and Detested
* ***Bound By:*** Helwyn, Horn-Bearer, upon his will, flesh, and eternal soul
## Final Clause
Let the name of Helwyn be written upon the chains of Malbolge, and let his horns adorn the Court of Beauty. From this moment until his death, Glasya’s hand shall not reach for him nor those companions bound to his fate at this hour. When his final breath is drawn, his soul shall fall, and Glasya shall smile.

# Fallout
Helwyn gave up her soul to not have to get the Book of Nine Dooms from Arran and not be hunted by Glasya's cult.
## Character Punishment
The colour of your sleep is red: blood, fire, burning rage. You don’t dream, not in the normal sense. When you close your eyes, all you see is red. You wake bathed in sweat, with your heart pounding, but you can’t remember any details beyond that single colour.
## Lost Soul
When a character whose soul is trapped in the Nine Hells dies, resurrection magic can return that character to life no matter how much time has passed. For example, a Revivify spell works on the character even if a week has passed since the character died. However, if the character's body is completely destroyed, not even a Wish or True Resurrection spell can bring the character back.
## Phylactery Location
The Sign of the Hag’s Arms, Malbolge, Gehenna. The character’s soul is a servant ordered to perform a series of impossible tasks: cleaning out entire stables in a single day; serving a perfectly cooked meal despite a fire that won't stay lit; delivering a message across deadly terrain without weapons or armour. With each failure, the character’s overseer—a ruthless hag—subjects the character's soul to a series of brutal tortures to “teach” them the error of their ways.
## Anger Characteristics
A person full of hate is blind to the effects their actions can have. To fulfil their vendetta, they’re willing to alienate and even hurt those close to them.
### Boon Ability
When you make an attack roll or skill check you can choose to change the roll to a 20. If you choose to do this all Charisma, Intelligence, and Wisdom checks are made at disadvantage for the next hour. Once you use this boon, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.
