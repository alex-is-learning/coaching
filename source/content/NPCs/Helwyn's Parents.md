- Live in [[Snowfall]]
- Distant and cold, favouring their first child [[Estrid]] over [[Helwyn]] at every possibility and trying to keep her out of sight as much as possible, palming her off to [[Yrsa]] around 9 or 10
- Proud Austri mostly live in the Green Light of the East. Behind the walls of the capital city [[Thorath]] they are building a civilization, the likes of which no one has ever seen in Svilland. Armies in green cloaks, wander in the wild to protect the people of the kingdom. They are the most honourable humans in the Nordic lands, if you ask them
- They deem most “weird looking races” as monsters
