- So I've been embedded in the "healing" space for ~3 years now
	- See [So you want to learn about the post-rationalist "healing" space? (2025-11-10)](https://alexislearning.me/scrapbook/3.-Improving-lived-experience/1.-Healing/So-you-want-to-learn-about-the-post-rationalist-%22healing%22-space-(2025-11-10))
- I want to do more (free!) coaching, as an experiment!

# Hypothesis - coaching can be simple
- I think coaching can be really quite simple:
	1. Create a container
	2. Use some simple tools
## 1. Creating  a container for people to think about things
- It can be hard to sit down for an hour and make progress on something
- It is often *much easier* to do this with another person present, for reasons like:
	- Dialogue
	- Sounding board
	- Maintaining focus
	- Attunement
## 2. There are simple & powerful tools that can be used
- I can blend in techniques like:
	- Internal Family Systems therapy
	- Eugene Gendlin's "Focusing"
	- Art of Accomplishment's "VIEW" framework
- Often, the meta-move is simply "what feeling are you avoiding right now?", "what part of your experience are you rejecting?", and this can be much easier to interface with when someone else is holding space for you
## Boom, I think it's that simple! 
- I honestly think that this is the 80/20. Create a container, use some simple moves when necessary
