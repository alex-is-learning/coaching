# Last Session's Recap
![[Session 01#^summary]]
# Session Summary
## New Companions
* Hired by [[Chief Luptir]] to guard a caravan heading for [[Kroksholt]] and introduced us to [[Eliziel]], whose god has sent her our way
* We were found by [[Joy]] who has come to assist Dirge and anyone who's near him

## A Perilous Journey
* On the path to Kroksholt, we are attacked by undead creatures, but manage to defeat them
* We're found by [[Flortes]], an ogre who determines that we are their collective 'mum' (what's with all the mothers in this game?)
* Tracked them back to their base to find a gnoll mage transforming abyssal hyenas into gnoll marauders
* I managed to steal the [[Book of Nine Dooms]] from him and gave it to Arran
* As he died, the mage spoke of the fact that the [[Doomspeakers]] would not stop hunting for us and the book
## Off the Beaten Path
* Our driver diverts towards Eastern Look due to blood rain (a rare weather phenomenon) over the path to Kroksholt
* We reach a small village of outcasts, where they each have some sort of deformity. Their leader, Father ???, has a demonic-looking arm
