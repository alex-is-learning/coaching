# What Happened?
## Lost to the Night
- Arran, our ogre son, and caravan guards were splendidly kidnapped without us noticing thanks to Hayden’s natural 20
- After interrogating the local priest, who we had discovered had something undead inside him, we found out that the people in this village were cultists of [[The Sanguine Path]]
- They worship Alucard’s son, and were planning to sacrifice everyone in a ritual at the local church
## An Unholy Battle
- A fight ensued with a bunch of cultists and vampire spawn
- Ravaria got tuberculosis, and 3 of the 6 caravan guards were drained dry, but we eventually managed to wipe them out
- We interrogated the few surviving cultists to learn more about the Path, with the most important discovery being that one of their leaders is a literal talking pig. We have promised the ogre that he can eat it.
## Smooth Criminals
- Got to [[Eastern Look]] with no further incidents. Half the party ended up getting addicted to gambling, but we were banned after several very blatant rounds of cheating. They couldn’t prove it, but casting guidance and bardic inspiration at the table was pushing things a little too much. Ogre ate some plague-riddled corpses when we weren’t looking but he tanked it, all good
- Finally got to the capital of [[Thorath]], where we met with [[Eero Toivonen]], the queen’s advisor and our contact who’d put us in touch with Her Majesty
- Unfortunately, said monarch had just suffered an assassination attempt and would not be available to meet with us until tomorrow
## Something Wicked...
- Instead ,we went to the local Church of Kae in the Noble’s Quarters to discuss how there were now literally three different cults up to various shenanigans
- Usi chose that moment to show up with several minotaurs in tow. During his monologuing, he mentions ANOTHER cult called [[Black Goat]]. A very difficult fight happened where we killed the minotaurs but got our asses handed to us by Usi, who left through a portal (but not before giving us a parting gift of an enlarged fireball)
- Most of the party got downed and the church is on fire...
# Things for Next Time?
- Talk to Eliziel about her temple being attacked
