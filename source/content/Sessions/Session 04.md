# What Happened?
## The Aftermath
- After the fireball at Kae's Temple, we found that Eliziel had been destroyed by it, turned into nothing but dust [[Arran|Arran Tirran]]
- Eero informed us that he would find us another companion to help our cause, and that Arran had awakened from his magical coma
- Checking Arran over, it appears like he is still missing a part of his soul from where the cultists drained him for their ritual, and that he would be vulnerable to magical attacks for a while
## Meeting Martyn
- Introduction of [[Martyn]], an elderly man who delivers message of a passing to their loved one
- He is met by Eero, who says that the Queen has need of Martyn's ship
- In return, she will hire him to help guide a group with their next contract
- Martyn is brought to meet us and, once introductions are made, Eero takes us to the Queen
## An Audience with the Queen
- An assassination attempt was made against her. There are a number of cults attempting to sow chaos across the Green Lights in an effort to bring demons about (specifically [[Ulsedra Vox]]) as part of a ritual they are performing at a temple in [[Nulb Temple]]
- The Queen sent spies to infiltrate the temple but they were eliminated, managing to retrieve a [[Cult List|list of cults]] involved
- Due to not knowing who to trust in her court and her people being too overt, the Queen is tasking us with dealing with the cults' leaders using subterfuge
- We have a week before the ritual is completed (Martyn should be able to get us there in 3 days)
- In exchange, she will grant whatever we wish in exchange for the contract, plus a blue sapphire each. We agreed to the contract, and set out on a wagon driven by Thelonia
## The Road to Nulb
- On the second night, Ravaria is visited by Glasya who instructs her to prove herself after failing to retrieve the [[Book of Nine Dooms]], either by handing over her soul or killing Dirge
- Ravaria agrees to kill Dirge, sneaking up to him and placing a blade to his throat. Ravaria tries to kill him, but Dirge's Shield spell keeps him safe
- Arran and Mother wake up due to their light sleeping and demand to know what is happening. Mother throws an axe at Ravaria but misses
- Arran wakes Helwyn, who shoots across the cart and grabs Ravaria's wrist with the weapon
- Arran tackles Ravaria out of the wagon and the party tie her up. Helwyn tries to intervene between Ravaria and the rest of the group, drawing anger from Arran
- Glasya visits Ravaria again, asking once more for her soul as she hesitated when trying to kill Dirge. Ravaria refuses, and Glasya allows Ravaria's curse to transform her into a demon. Dirge hits her with a guiding bolt and kills her, her body reverting back to her usual form
## The Deal
- Helwyn attempts to explain herself to the party, but before she can, Glasya visits her. She makes her a choice: Get her the Book, or forfeit her soul which will drive in her a bloodlust that could harm her friends down the road
- With Helwyn conflicted about what to do, Glasya sweetens the deal: there is a traitor in their midst already and Glasya will share who it is... for Helwyn's horns. Helwyn accepts and Glasya informs her that Joy is working for Black Goat and an ambush has been set for them at the temple
- Helwyn decides that she cannot deceive her party, and gives up her soul. Time returns, Helwyn's horns shedding and an emptiness fills her. The party are confused, but Helwyn says that a deal has been made and that they need to move on
- Dirge performs funeral rites on Ravaria by using Sacred Flame to burn the body, and collects some of the ashes to be able to lay her to rest 
- Arran is furious with Helwyn for defending someone who attacked their friend and moves to the front of the wagon with Thelonia
## The Temple Looms
- As they draw near to the temple, Helwyn moves up and asks Thelonia to stop the wagon. She tells Arran they need to talk, so they head out quietly into the forest
- Helwyn tells Arran that Joy is betraying them and that they cannot risk going into the temple. Arran believes her, but is unsure what to do with this information. They decide that Arran will lure Joy away and give Helwyn time to inform the others, so that they can deal with Joy before approaching the temple
- Arran asks Joy to help him collect components for his spells. Joy insights with a dirty 20, but Arran rolls a nat 20 on his deception - talk about the dice coming in when it counts!
- Arran and Joy head off and Helwyn informs the others about Joy. Dirge casts Zone of Truth and Helwyn confirms what she knows to be true. They head after Joy and Arran
## An Ode to Joy
- Joy hits Arran with Words of Terror, causing him to be frightened. As Arran runs towards them, Dirge casts Silence around Joy as Helwyn charges up, managing to grapple her. The party manage to tie her up
- Joy reveals herself to be [[Joy|Rags]], and provides information on what's waiting for them after Helwyn uncharacteristically tortures her. After giving all her information, Arran kills Joy
- Leaving Joy's body tied in the forests, the team prepare to face what is waiting for them in the Temple of Nulb...
# Things for Next Time?
- Thanking Arran for trusting her
- Discuss with Dirge around her lack of soul
- Deal with however Ravaria and Eliziel come back
