# Recap

# What Happened?
## A Tough Decision
- During camp, [[Ravaria]] tells us that she's struggling with her combat skills not being up to scratch. She's not used to having free will, having been a soldier all her life and always being commanded by [[Glasya]]. She says that she knows people don't want her in the party, and that she would part ways at [[Dockyard]] if we didn't want her there. She heads off into the forest for the party to discuss. We deliberate, but decide that Ravaria should stay: she needs support to give her a chance to be a better person and we're the best she's got (gods help her)
- [[Helwyn]] goes to tell her the news and also provides an apology: She failed to honour her deal and keep [[Ravaria]] alive. [[Ravaria]] says that she's not to blame, and that [[Glasya]] had given them both impossible tasks. [[Helwyn]] doesn't really respond and instead stays in the forest for a while as [[Ravaria]] heads back to the party
## Scams and Surprises
- [[Ravaria]] goes to find a contact from her old cult who could get us passage to [[Hamlin|The True King]]'s domain. She finds someone who says that he can get us smuggled in for 200 gold, one-time offer! [[Ravaria]] agrees (WHY?), then robs [[M0-TH3R|Mother]] to pay for it. The contact says we should meet up with someone called [[The Burned One]] at [[Nattarfaravik]] and they'd get us over the border. No description, no guarantees. Sigh...
- [[Martyn]], already having hit up a tavern on getting to town, delivers one of his letters to a dwarven man. A tense situation to start, but the dwarf tells him that he had been a sailor too, and for [[Martyn]] not to blame himself for the fate of his crew. [[Martyn]] goes to drink his sorrows away (even more), but stumbles upon us giving [[Ravaria]] shit for stealing our money to a person she's never met before for us to meet another person that we've also never met before - great start to [[Ravaria]]'s rebrand!
- A random drunk helpfully points out a smokey figure outside the tavern with a sign saying "[[Martyn]]". We go and talk to them: it's [[Cinderhide]], making our job way easier than we thought it would be. He says that the giant warship docked behind him is ours and that we have a package from [[Usi-Ziyad|Usi]] for him. We give him the meat and try to ask him some questions, but he ruins it by eating the meat and exploding all over us (RUDE)
- After [[Dirge]] dry-cleans us all, we discuss whether we should go anywhere near this warship, if we can trust this deal and if anyone in town knows more about this ship (probably not a good look to accidentally steal it). Meanwhile, one of the Bobs expertly reverses the [[Helwyn's Chop Shop|Chop Shop]] at high speed onto ship's loading platform without even a scratch - that's my Bob!
## Setting Sail (Eventually)
- We board the ship to find [[Ludmilla]], who claims that she is an envoy for someone of great import (totally [[Venin|The Moonbearer]]) and that the warship has been gifted to us (well, [[Martyn]] specifically) by said person who she cannot reveal too much about (totally [[Venin|The Moonbearer]]). She says we _could_ take it to see [[Hamlin|The True King]], but he's the only fighter in the place, so is there any point *really*? Much better to come see [[Venin]] directly, and if we want to dispatch him we're welcome to try!
- She also says that she can guarantee [[Lily]] will be there, so [[Eliziel]] (back from her ash-nap in [[Dirge]]'s bottle) is immediately onboard. [[Arran]] and [[Martyn]] want [[Ludmilla]] overboard, not trusting a single word she says (fair). After WAY too much discussion about where we even want to go, we decide that taking the ship to [[Endkleistra]] is our best chance to get near to [[Venin]], get back [[Lily]] and do the job that the Queen has laid out for us: remove the cult leaders and secure [[Alsvartr]].
- Having searched the ship for anything remotely suspicious and finding nothing, we finally set off to [[Endkleistra]]. Thanks to a fun game (or psychological warfare depending on who you ask) where we secretly voted on how we levelled up, we jumped up to level 7! Training montages ensue: [[Eliziel]] and [[Ravaria]] beating the shit out of each other, [[Helwyn]] and the Bobs attempting to learn welding to help a [[M0-TH3R|Mother]] out, [[Arran]] walking around the entire boat refusing to STOP READING BOOKS YOU NERD
## Proving Grounds
- Once we reach [[Endkleistra]], [[Ludmilla]] takes us to the [[Thunderfall Arena]], where deadly battles are played out for a massive bloodthirsty audience (are you not entertained?!) [[Venin|Gorgun]] is watching, and if we're victorious, we'll be granted an audience with him
- The fight actually goes surprisingly well given our track record. The creatures (Le Angry and Le Hungry) can steal any healing that we try to do or get advantage from being attacked (BOO), but [[Eliziel]] saves [[Helwyn]]'s life, [[M0-TH3R|Mother]] fights on the brink of death the entire time and [[Ravaria]] only almost dies once! Granted it was by taking a dip in some lava, but still, progress!
- Having defeated the creatures to the roars (and possibly boos) of the crowds, we prepare for our meeting with [[Venin|Gorgun]]...
