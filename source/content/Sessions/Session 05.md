# What Happened?
## Ambushing the Ambush
- The gang (+ Thelonia our cart driver) had just finished torturing and murdering Joy when our new friend Martyn decided to leg it for some reason! Weird.
- Make our way back to the temple, looking for a way to avoid walking through the front door into an ambush. Arran sends his owl-friend up and around, finding only one other way in: a crumbled wall towards the back of the temple. We also find an unfamiliar dead body - naked, lacerated and exsanguinated - outside the western wall. Dirge REFUSES to give it a proper send-off right away - terrible clericing in Helywn's opinion.
- We decide to stealth to the crumbled wall. Managing to somehow clear rubble without any noticeable sound, we find a throne room containing a bronze bowl with a keyhole, as well as 4 cultists and their leader, a [[Kara Blayne|Pirate Queen]] praying to the [[Demagorgon]] with a key around her neck.
- Helwyn goes in for a surprise attack against the Pirate Queen, drawing the attacks of the cultists. Helwyn expertly avoids their attacks using dope monk shit before taking a bullet to the dome from the Queen's revolver, dying immediately. The Queen double-taps her as she's lying on the floor - absolute professional.
- The fight goes pretty well for the party, except for Helwyn going completely deaf and losing an eye in a chandelier attack (don't ask), but we take out the cultists and take the key.
- The other two cults and their leaders are coming from further down the temple after hearing the gunshots, so we use the key on the bowl which opens up a portal. We dive into it to avoid the other cults.
## Elemental Showdown
- We find ourselves in a strange room, with portals to elemental planes in the four corners. In front of us stands [[Ulsedra Vox]], the Para-Elemental Queen, while behind chained up on the wall is... [[Eliziel]]?!
- Ulsedra says something to us in Abyssal (but obviously Helwyn's the only one who understands it and, again, SHE'S DEAF) before transforming into an para-elemental entity and attacking.
- Arran and Helwyn go left as the others go in for attacks. Arran decides to take down the Ooze Elemental in the corner while Helwyn goes straight for getting Eliziel free, with Dirge joining soon after.
- Mother and Thelonia fight off the remaining elementals and Ulsedra, Mother going down
- Helwyn frees a couple of Eliziel's restraints before Dirge motions to Arran being dunked in the Ooze Realm like a chicken nugget (she didn't hear this commotion behind her because, as I may have mentioned, SHE'S DEAF).
- Helwyn rushes to Prison Wizard's aid, dispatching the Ooze monster and dragging Arran out of the portal (Medical note: Ooze stings like a BITCH). Dirge gets resurrected Eliziel up to speed ("Shit's crazy, start killing and I'll explain later") and she busts out of her chains like the Hulk.
- The gang continue the fight, taking out the other elementals before bringing Ulsedra down to her human form, forcing her to surrender.
## The Ol' Bait-and-Switch
- She tells us that she's a figurehead for these cults, acting as the Big Bad so that [[Queen Bergljot]]'s forces are misdirected this way and the cults can get busy poisoning the shit out of her and the rest of her city in the festivities.
- We tie her up and take her with us to face justice, despite Arran's protests that she cannot be trusted. When we get back up into the temple proper, the other cultists and their leaders have fled the scene like COWARDS.
## Meanwhile...
- [[Ravaria]] is wandering Limbo when she's met by a strange entity who offers her a trip back to the mortal realm. All she has to do is let him tag along to experience world stories. She agrees and the entity hands over a lantern.
- Ravaria awakens on the spot where she had bit the dust, only this time cold, alone and with a lantern in hand. She heads into the woods and finds an abandoned cabin, taking shelter for the night.
## ...Back Again
- During the trip back, we wake to find Ulsedra murdered in her sleep. Arran admits to killing her during the night, and the gang bring up the excellent point of "What the Actual Fuck? Ravaria Much?"
- A now younger-looking and healthier Ravaria, hearing the argument and her own name being mentioned, shares her opinion (100% Pro-Murder). Helwyn tries to tackle her and crashes through the cabin wall, thanks to stupid lack of depth perception, as Ravaria misty-steps over to Arran, who swings at her and misses.
- Ravaria explains that she was forced to try and kill Dirge and that she was killed for refusing to lose her soul. Helwyn is PISSED at her, which the totally-normal talking lantern (who later introduces himself as [[Mr Storyteller]]) helpfully explains is because of their interactions with Glasya.
- Helwyn and Ravaria explains the whole Archdevil deals, which the party don't love (as Dirge puts it, Helwyn is "Capital-F-Fucked"). A couple of the party point out that we need to get back to Kroksholt and that, even if we don't trust each other, we need to work together to stop the assassination.
- We pass near a wonderful little village worshipping Ares and celebrating peace and love, but NO TIME FOR THAT SHIT.
## A Plot Foiled
- Exhausted, we reach the capital and get to the Queen, but Eero the Traitor is there. We make our accusations with very little hard evidence, but we manage to convince her. Eero manages to slip away in the discussion, damn it.
- The reports are in: the ale contained hallucinogenic mushrooms (we got a sample for Research Purposes, of course); damage to the cityfolk is minimal; the tampered ale casks were marked with a pentagram made out of wheat stalks with a crescent moon in the middle (VERY culty); the poisoned goods were let in through the disused western gate 
- The Queen delivers on her wishes: Dirge gets made an Inquisitor; Arran gets the Book (and something else?); Eliziel gets an audience with someone who could get her in touch with the one of the Kings in the West; Helwyn gets training from the Queen's healers and old letters from her mentor; Rivaria gets NOTHING, YOU LOSE, GOOD DAY MADAM
- Mother asks for the ability to experience true feelings/emotions, to which the Queen replies "Yeah, can't do that. Good job though!"
- We also each get a sapphire worth 1000g and Joy's cut of the money as a bonus, and all our names are cleared of criminal charges (just in time for Arran's lengthy prison sentence!)
## (Axe)Homeward Bound
- The Queen's got intel that the cults are currently holed up in [[Axehome]], a town heading north out of Kroksholt. After providing Helwyn with her new mobile doctoring wagon (working name: Helwyn's Chop Shop) and some apprentices, the gang pack up to head off.
- BUT FIRST, we gotta hit up Artefacts R Us and buy out that sweet, sweet merch...
# Things for Next Time?
- Ravaria: Apologise for being angry? Give her shit for letting her down?
- Dirge: What does the whole 'soul being gone' mean? I'm only up to speed on the life healing side of the coin
- Martyn: Where the fuck did you go?
- Mother: No purpose or direction - I get it
- Group: (Trauma) sharing is caring
- Eliziel: I'm sorry about your god's temples
- Reading Yrsa's letters, struggling to sleep, interacting with my Choppers (working title for my apprentices)
