# What Happened?
## Take Me (Axe)Home
- We've been tasked by the [[Queen Bergljot|Queen]] with heading to [[Axehome]], where [[Eero Toivonen|Eero]] and other cultists had (potentially) booked it to. A quick level-up, then all aboard the [[Helwyn's Chop Shop|Chop Shop]]!
- [[Martyn]] is approached by [[Usi-Ziyad|Usi]] who informs him that he's best buddies with us and that he knows where we are. Usi offers to take him to our camp out of the goodness of his own heart (aww)
- He also offers Martyn a job: deliver a moist envelope to a person with reddish skin and a brown cloak in [[Dockyard]], and Usi will give him a ship. Also, do not open said wet envelope. Absolutely nothing suspicious about that in any way, shape or form
- Martyn takes him up on that offer, and they share a horse towards Axehome
## A Party without Purpose
- Martyn and Usi find our group, who (understandably) are pretty hostile towards the guy who firebombed the crap out of us and a holy temple. After failed attempts to restrain him, Usi does his *Guys, I'm really not a bad person, maybe join the Fire Gang?* schtick. After we tell him to piss off, Usi does piss off (Huh. Actually worked.) [[Arran]]'s owl attempts to follow him, but Usi vanishes into the Mirror Dimension<sup>TM</sup>
- Martyn explains his disappearance at the temple: He cracked out of fear and ran. Bad shit goes down when he gets stressed or scared, and he didn't want that happening again, not after losing the crew of his ship a few months back
- [[Dirge]] wonders if [[Mr Storyteller]] is possibly a way for Usi to watch us, and whether he can do the runic magic as well. Mr S takes control of [[Ravaria]]'s will, making her dance, lick the ground, then share a story about [[Glasya]]
- She tells us how all her life she has followed Glasya's every word, and that now she has no idea what to do with all this sudden free will. A few of the party members seem to know that feeling, but they share their opinion that not everyone is this world is out to use or exploit you
## Deer Old Cinderhide
- Martyn also shares the delivery Usi assigned him and we (again, understandably) freak out about it, treating that parcel like we're a bomb squad. No magic, nothing unusual, just your average dripping wet package
- We open it up to find a slice of still-sorta-maybe-good venison and a note that reads "Enjoy your fresh meat, [[Cinderhide]]". The group go into full-blown paranoia: He knows we were going to open it, it's a trap! Unless he KNOWS we know he knows, and it's a double-bluff! Nothing gets done for a solid in-game hour or so
- We decide to focus on the Axehome mission, with the sorta-maybe aim to check out [[Dockyard]] and the parcel's recipient. Afterwards, we all let our hair down with a nice game of Shoot the Trees with a Magic GunTM before turning in for the night
## A Charming Town
- On the way into town, Dirge has a migraine-vision from [[Alucard]]: a giant hole in the earth some ways outside of Axehome that fills the god with fear, which definitely ain't good. We get into the town proper to find people crawling through the mud, legs broken. Helwyn's apprentices spring into action, helping anyone they can
- One of the injured claims a curse has been stealing people away and harming others over the past fortnight, with the Barkeep's daughter being kidnapped two days before. It's originating from the Burrow, a tomb containing the remains of a [[Wizard with No Name]]. They point us towards the [[Tolin|Village Elder]]'s house for more info, plus mention how Johann the Blacksmith has been strange recently, working all day and night and saying nada
- We decide to visit Johann. He's a dwarf with an impressive full-length beard that's forging swords, an even more impressive act considering the forge's complete lack of fire. Dirge works out that the dwarvenness is not the creature's true form, but we cannot shake them out of their working stupor or get anything useful out of them
- We move onto the Village Elder's house, who introduces himself as Tolin. He confirms that the Wizard with No Name placed a curse on Axehome but honestly, seems pretty unperturbed by it all. Huh, weird!
## Fuck Around...
- We finally hit up the bar: inside is a tiefling woman, two starved mastiffs that Ravaria tries (and fails) to befriend and the Barkeep, Beatrice. We pry Beatrice for more information on this curse going around but get pretty much nothing new.
- Martyn sneaks upstairs to search for clues and finds what we all know is a guaranteed source of all the town's hot goss: A fourteen-year-old's secret diary. Meanwhile, Beatrice insists on providing food and drink even though yeah, no, we're good thanks. The tiefling woman smacks the fare onto the floor, telling us it's poisoned. As Dirge goes to pick up the food (five-second rule!) Beatrice tries to stab him in the back and gets KOed by the tiefling
- She introduces herself as Katherine, a fellow adventurer who's hunting down a cambion (half-tiefling, half-devil) sorcerer by the name of Eliyas. Axehome's kidnappings and general fuckery has his name written all over it, and she's pretty sure he's after the Demon's Heart, an artefact stored away in the Wizard's tomb. She's after it too, contracted by 'royalty' to deliver the Heart to them, and she can get us close to them if we help her out
- We head back to check on the Blacksmith only to find him AWOL. We break into his house (heroically) to find Johann's week-old body on the floor, killed by the fire magic from a staff. Classic Eero! Looks like our boy's working with Eliyas, which means double trouble awaits
## ...And Find Out
- Wasting no (extra) time, we head to the Burrow. Inside, we find nobody but a sarcophagus protected by the Hallowed spell, its lid carved into the body of a man (who holds the Heart) and Abyssal runes written around the edge. Ravaria and Helwyn relay their story: A warlock, whose Demon Lord demanded an heir. They tricked a tiefling into conceiving the Demon Lord's child, that tiefling being ~~Helwyn~~Katherine. No love's lost for Eliyas though, she'll happily fuck him up to get the Heart and break her contract
- Dirge breaks the Hallowed spell and grabs the goods, but Dead Wizard activates and summons some shroud lackeys to back him up. A fight breaks out where Mother loses an eye (twins!) and Ravaria/Helwyn repeatedly fail to learn that necrotic damage does fuck-all to ghosts, but we eventually take Dead Wizard down thanks to Dirge's spotting of his one weakness: love (also, his ghostly heart being susceptible to punching and stabbing)
- Once we cleared the spirits out, our old pal Eero turns up with his buddy Eliyas. They've waited for us to deal with the ancient shit so they could swoop in and steal the loot (dicks). Another fight breaks out, this time ending with Eero being Falcon-Punched in the chest by Helwyn and Eliyas teleporting away like the COWARD he is
## Next Steps
- The Heart secure, Katherine reveals that her boss is none other than [[Venin]], and that she can bring us to his court in Endkliestra. We reckon that it might be worth heading up the Red River and getting our audience with the King in the North first though, as we're going to need all the allies we can get. Arran wants to go check on the book that Usi was after in Grey Town, so a quick detour and we'll get right on with saving the world (promise...)
# RP Things for Next Time?
- Mother:
	- Offer to help her understand her own systems, at least from a biological point of view
	- Help her find a new eye in her old home in Grey Town
	- Share about how she was showing Joy no mercy and would have left her to die
- Ravaria:
	- Apologise for not saving her like she was supposed to
- The Chop Shop Bobs:
	- Apologise for how Helwyn has treated them
	- She's been in a bad place and suddenly had all these people learning from her
	- She panicked and defaulted to shitty behaviour, but it's not what Yrsa would do
	- She'll be doing better from now on, promise, and they can interact with the party more if they'd like (might even learn something from them)
