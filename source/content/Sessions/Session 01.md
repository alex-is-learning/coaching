# What Happened?

## Meet the Party
* [[M0-TH3R]]'s systems start up again and she finds herself in a basement, her ward now grown to an adult. She is being reset by her ward, but before it can be finished she breaks the teenager's neck, cancelling her oath to protect them. Her programming rewiring, she stumbles out into [[Grey Town]] to find the people manic and dancing. They see her, a valuable artefact, and launch themselves at her, taking her to the ground...
* [[Helwyn]] is manacled by a group of mercenaries. Some are murdered by [[Usi-Ziyad|Usi]], who says he is part of the [[Order of Falling Ash]], the rest joining his order. He drops the keys in front of Helwyn and leaves. Helwyn runs but hears the voice of [[Glasya]], who directs her to find her champion, one with a shadow that does not match...
* [[Ravaria]] sits at a pool of water, corruption running through her. Her 'mother', Glasya, tells her that she is bringing a healer of her bloodline to help as Helwyn arrives. As they are introducing themselves, the temple in Grey Town across the waters erupts into flames...
* [[Dirge]] is praying at the Temple of Alucard when he is informed of a contact that he must find in Grey Town. He travels there, and once arriving finds an old woman who is the only one not driven mad. She says the town has been corrupted by a sickness from the waters, and urges Dirge to save her son. Dirge recalls the undead monster that can do this and vows to destroy it as his faith decrees. He finds Mother being attacked by the citizens and manages to break her free, just as the temple of Tyr(?) sets alight...
* [[Arran]] is brought before [[Chief Luptir]], who informs him that his sentence has now been paid and he is a free man. As they speak, Usi arrives at the temple, demanding a book or he will burn down the temple. The Chief and Arran refuse to give him the book, so the temple is set alight...
## The Order Strikes
* The group come together and fight Usi's minions. One manages to get away but leaves a fiery trail leading to a house in the woods
* [[Daedre]] is standing outside, building up the courage to go in to what she claims is a hag's house. Helwyn remembers the stories of [[Shtriga Nonna]] from Yrsa, who failed to defeat her and knows that this is Bad Juju
## A Hag's Lair
* The party enter and find a simple cottage. A sign reads "Do not disturb the cats", so obviously Ravaria and Dirge mess with the ghost cats
* We entered a forest of blood and gore. We managed to find our way through, avoiding a chimera, and found Shtriga Nonna and the undead creature
* We killed her and the creature, freeing the woman's son: a kobold. Victorious, we head back towards Grey Town...

Blah blah blah.
