#### Backstory
Poppy was rased by grandfather Lihng, a survivor of the [[apostasy]]. He was one of the founding members of the [[Celenium Athenium]]. But got injured in one of the battles against [[The Damask Queens]], after seeing what all this violence is doing the other enduring and now to himself he decided to leave the [[Celenium Athenium]] and spent his time bringing up his grandson teaching him to care for other people instead of destroying them. Years later, on his death bed Lihng said to Poppy that not all hope is lost. Lihng believed that a book exists detailing the arrival of the gods. He said with his last words to [[Puong Phi Van Minh|Poppy]] that he must find this book to change the fate of this plane. 

In his study Poppy found a lot of notes about the old world and possible locations for this book. The research was extensive but unconclusive. Wanting to honour the wishes of his grandfather Poppy studied his research, gathered his stuff and sat out to find the book of [[Umbraje|The Origins of the Gods]].

Travels to [[Amber Reach]] meets [[Skivnn the wisper Vvarn|Skivnn]] after a job going wrong heals him and tries to get him on the right path

Can't do this alone after some fighting realises that while his grandfather wanted to him to help not destroy, he will have to learn to attack. To defend himselve and the people he cares about.
Searches for help and finds it in [[Zandpunt]] where he meets [[Mahmoud Lightbringer]] and [[Almeas]] and realises that their becaus might have a lot in common. So he helps them with their knowledge his grandfather gave him to find more clanks and hopefully one day the book of [[Umbraje|The Origins of the Gods]]. Mostly on the sideline but knowing that one day he will have to confront the wastelands if he wishes to complete his goal.
