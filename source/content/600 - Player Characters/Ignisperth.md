As the elders of the village predicted the curse bestowed not only on the world but upon their young as well leaving several eggs unhatched and those that hatched came out umbra touched. Having to slay their young the instant they were born. Just when one of the warriors raised its sword to end the life of this last young, something even the elders could not anticipate happened. A blinding light lit the dark corrupted sky, as flame originating from the mouth of this new Drakona, burst miles high into the sky crushing all the corrupted clouds and the sun shined bright on the encampment. The elders stopped the killing as they believed they this newborn was the way to revert wat was done with this plane, they named it [[Ignisperth]], in its native language meaning LIGHT OF HOPE.
